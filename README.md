DECEMBER 12, 2023 The   exam   begins   at   8:00am   Pacific   on   December   12,   2023.   You   have   150   minutes   to   complete   the   exam.    Provide   sufficient   reasoning   to   back   up   your   answer   but   do   not   write more than necessary.    Show all work,   do not just   write   an   answer.    For questions   that use a calculator, make sure to write down the   formula   you   are   using   that   is   typed   into   the   calculator.   Please   make   your   final   results   easy   to   read.
Problem 1. A   claim   size   random   variable   X   follows   a   loglogistic   distribution.   You   are   given   the   following   information.
•   The   20th      percentile   of   this   claim   size   distribution   is   350.
•   The   80th    percentile   of this   claim   size   distribution   is   1400.   Determine   P(X   >   700).Problem 2. The   dollar   value   of   the   total   damagedone   to   a   home   due   to   a   fire   follows a   Pareto   distribution   with   α   =   2.7   and   θ   =   45,   000.    ABC   Fire   Insurance   Company writes   homeowner’s   fire   insurance   policies.      Each   policy   has   the   following   coverage   modifications.
•   A   deductible   of   $500.
•   ABC   Fire   Insurance   Company will   pay   92%   of the   loss   after the   deductible   is   met.
•   ABC   Fire   Insurance   Company   will   pay   a   maximum   amount   of   $100,   000   per   fire   insurance   policy.
(i) (6 points)   Compute   the   expected   payment   the   ABC   Fire   Insurance   Company   will make   per   policy.(ii) (4   points)   If   the   dollar   value   of   the   total   damage   done   to   a   home   due   to   a   fire   is   inflated   by    15%   and   all   coverage   modifications   remain   unchanged,   compute   the   expected   payment   the   ABC   Fire   Insurance   Company   will   make   per   policy.
Problem 3. You have been asked to build   a   compound   frequency   model   of the   usual   form.	
S = M1   + M2   + ···   + MN
where   N   has   a   negative   binomial   distribution   with   parameters   r   =   3   and   β   =   2   and M   has the   distribution
P(M   =   1) = 0.3,          P(M   = 2)   =   0.4,            ,   P(M   =   4)   =   0.3.
Compute   P(S   ≤ 4).
Problem 4. You   are   given   the   following   information   on   the   losses   for   a   particular line   of business.
•   For   year   2002,   loss   sizes   followed   a   uniform   distribution   between   0   and   50代 写PSTAT 173 - RISK THEORY FINAL EXAMC/C++

•   In   year   2002   the   insurer   pays   100%   of   all   losses.
•   Inflation   of 6%   affects   all   losses   uniformly   from   year   2002   to   year   2003.
•   In   year   2003   a   deductible   of   200   is   applied   to   all   losses.
Compute   the   loss   elimination   ratio   (LER)   of the   200   deductible   on   year   2003   losses.
Problem 5. You   are   given   the   following   distributions   for   independent   loss   random   variables   X1   ,   X2   ,   and   X3   .
x                           f1(x)                       f2(x)                          f3(x)

Compute   the   net   stop-loss   premium   to   cover   the   aggregate   loss
S = X1   +   X2   +   X3
for   a   deductible   of d   =   45.Problem 6. An   insurance   company   has   decided   to   establish   its   full-credibility   re-   quirements   for   an   individual   state   rate   filing.    The   full-credibility   standard   is   to   be   set   so   that   the   observed   total   amount   of   claims   underlying   the   rate   filing   would   be   within 5%   of   the   true   value   with   probability   0.95.      The   claim   frequency   follows   a   Poisson   distribution   and   the   loss   severity   distribution   has   pdff(x) =   kx,            0   ≤ x   ≤   200 for   some   constant   k.    (The   density   is   0   for   x   > 200). 
Determine   the   expected   number   of   claims   necessary   to   obtain   full   credibility   using   the   normal   approximation.Problem 7. In   the   population   at   large   there   are   good   and   bad   drivers.    Good   drivers make up 80% of the population and   in   one   year   have   zero   claims   with   probability   0.8,   one   claim   with   probability   0.15   and   two   claims   with   probability   0.05.      Bad   drivers make   up   the   other   20%   of   the   population   and   have   zero,   one   or   two   claims   with   probabilities   0.3,   0.5   and   0.2   respectively.    A   certain   driver   has   one   claim   in   year    1   and   two   claims   in   year   2.
Compute the   expected   number   of claims   for this   driver   for year   3   given   this   informa-   tion.
